# 👋 Hey there, I am Abdelkader Haddag
I am a 🧑‍🎓 PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at [University of Sciences and Technoloy Oran - Mohamed Boudiaf](https://www.univ-usto.dz/). 🖥️ I work as a freelancer in software engineering and machine learning. I specialize in computer vision applications and research. I have a special interest in smart medical imaging systems. 🔬 My research in PhD is about **Human Action / Activity Recognition in Videos using Deep Learning and bio-inspired model** supervised by [Dr. Yedjour H.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/H-Yedjour-2) as part of [SIMPA lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/SIMPA-Signal-Image-Parole-Nacera-Benamrane).

I tend to have a 🧠 polymath personality with multiple interests that enrich my main stream. I am a multidisciplinary designer, productivity enthusiast, psychology, and non-fiction books worm. Furthermore, I love challenges and projects that get me to use both sides of my brain (i.e., logic and creativity as well).
