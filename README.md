# 👋 Hey there, I am Abdelkader Haddag
I am a 🧑‍🎓 PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at [University of Sciences and Technoloy Oran - Mohamed Boudiaf](https://www.univ-usto.dz/). 🖥️ 🖥️ I work as a freelancer in software engineering and machine learning. I specialize in computer vision applications and research. I have a special interest in smart medical imaging systems. 🔬 My research in PhD is about **Human Action Recognition using Deep Learning and bio-inspired model** supervised by [Dr. Yedjour H.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/H-Yedjour-2) as part of [SIMPA lab](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/SIMPA-Signal-Image-Parole-Nacera-Benamrane).

I tend to have a 🧠 polymath personality with multiple interests that enrich my main stream. I am a multidisciplinary designer, productivity enthusiast, psychology, and non-fiction books worm. Furthermore, I love challenges and projects that get me to use both sides of my brain (i.e., logic and creativity as well).

# 💼 What is in my briefcase
## 📆 I’m currently working on
### 🔭 Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning Projects:
#### (03-2022) PhD Project : HAR using Deep Learning and Bio-inspired models
As part of my PhD project, I am doing research about introducing a novel method to perform human action recognition using deep learning methods, fuzzy logic, and bio-inspired models.
#### (04-2021) Research project: Hajj surveillance system
I am working on a project for one of my clients (as a freelancer, consultant) to produce a system that operates in Mecca for automated Hajj surveillance starting from crowd counting, to crowd behavior analysis, and crowd behavior prediction and management.
### 💿 Software & networks engineering:
#### (01-2022) FTTH studies
I work on producing FTTH projects like zoning, DOE, and I perform automation scripting for the same client. I shifted from regular hours to freelance program in order to free up myself for freelancing and working on my PhD project.
### 🎨 Design and art
#### (05-2022) Personal brand
My personal brand is inspired by the Pharaoh and North African (roots) civilizations and cultures. It expresses my strive for excellence and my deep appreciation for my perfectionism that is part of my thinking idology and personality.
